Autotrophs' biological rates respond to temperature, we therefore need a mechanistic understanding of how these changes occur. Thermal Performance Curves 'TPCs' graphically show how these biological rates - usually measured as growth change over temperature -- generally this is a left-skewed curve with a peak growth rate at an optimum temperature.

These curves can be modelled with the Schoolfield equation...
