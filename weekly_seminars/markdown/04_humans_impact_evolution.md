# Adaption in a changing world: human influences on evolution.

__Dr Kiyoko Gotanda Cambridge University__

__what has caused the biodiversity that we see in the world?__

- Adaptation and adaptive divergence
- normally a phenotype is normally distributed
    - results of fitness function (mean is on peak fitness)
    - if fitness function changes then the peak fitness changes → selection
- previous studies have sampled a population and assumed that the selection is the same through time and between populations
- in reality selection is highly variable in time/space (between populations)

__Human influences on this already abundent distribution of selection pressures__

__Does humting affect adaptive behaviour?__

- Spear fishing
    - flight initiation distanve
        - Distance where prey flees an approaching predator
    - in barbados
    - protected reserves (no spear fishing)
    - other areas heve spear fishing
- fish inside the reserve have decreased anti-predaor behaviour
    - pattern holds true no matter how far off the reef the fish are.

__Does evolution influenc ethe evoluiton of Darwins finches? (galapogos islands)__

- yay iguaners!!
- Darwins finches
    - 14 recognized species
        - adaptive divergence within the islands
- there is a strong human influence on the islands
    - 30,000 perminant populations
    - 250,000 yearly visators
- Are human influences having an impact on the adaptive pressures for the finches…
- Ground finches (S, M, L)
    - it appears that there is still adaptive divergence occuring on the medium gorund finches (small morph and large morph)
    - this bimodality is less clear (collapse) → correlated with increase in human disturbance (population). More clear on populations closer to town
- are humans changing the niche characteristics of darwins ground finches
    - stoped concentrating – something about niche overlap
    - Niche Breadth
        - lower → eating not much of what food is availablie. Higher → eating a lot of what is available.
        - The closer to town the larger the niche breadth…
        - the closer to town the greater the niche overlap between small and medium…
    - Human foods!!! no selective pressure on the finches, they dont need to be specialised to eat the numan foods…
        - cafeteria experiment – looks fun
        - in town the finches prefered human foods to their native foods
        - not as clear out of town

__Does urbanizaton affect antipredator behaviour?__

- In town → expect increase density of predators and so expect faster anit-predator behaviour
    - or conversly there could be a reduced FID due to more stimuli abd becoming acostumed to all the noise and stuff… (THIS ONE IS TRUE!)
- Huamn stimulus
    - outside town has increased FID

__Invasive species (are invasive species chaniging antipredator behaviour in Darwins finches)__

- amoung island study
    - some islands are pristine, some have feral cars and black rats, some have been iradicated (would expect a reversion)
    - islands with invasive predators have increased FID
    - no reversion has been seen on islands with iradication
    - looks like the trait is evolved (genetic = maintained)
- but humans dont look like cats!!! (cat toy on remote control car!)
    - comprable results from human and fake cat stimulus
- Is it the cat?
    - Stuffed iguana!
        - If finchs recognize cat as predator then they wont respond as strongly to the iguana. 
        - Looks like possibly maybe for rural finches!!!!

__Impliocations__

- we have consequnces!!!!!

__Questions__

- the car makes noise → proberbly has some kind of effect
- popultaitons can be considered distinct → no genetic moving??
