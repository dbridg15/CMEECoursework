     \section{Methods}
     A Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated between the mean annual temperature at Key West, Florida for 1901-2000 (N) with 1900-1999 (N-1). The significance of this was then calculated by repeating the correlation on a randomly sampled set of years 1901-2000.
     \section{Results}
     A significant positive correlation was found between temperature of years (N-1) and years (N) ($r{97} = 0.3262, p < 0.001$), with the p-value consistantly $<$ 0.001 when the analysis was re-run.
